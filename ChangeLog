ppp CHANGELOG

2018-05-07:
Changes:
- Moved files from http://www.xet7.org/ppp to GitHub
- Added Simplified BSD License

2007-11-16:
Changes:
- PPPv3 from John merged
- made StartMinGW.bat file for adding paths to get compiling on Vista working
  because Vista has security changes so MinGW Studio can't find cc1.exe and as.exe,
  found this path info from http://www.nabble.com/cc1-not-found-t3488675.html
- changed Makefile to remove CFLAGS -O2 and add LDFLAGS -lm
  (Makefile is used on Linux, on Windows MinGW uses project file settings)
Misc notes:
- John's PPPv3 c-version compiles on Ubuntu without my changes too,
  though then installing binary needs to be made with cp, not "sudo make install"
- on Ubuntu compiled John's version is 54164 bytes and my version 53647 bytes
  (517 bytes smaller), maybe because of:
    - John's version compiles with cc and mine with gcc
    - or compiler flags
    - or my code changes in ppp.c
    - or something else...
- Windows Open Source PPPv3 version and Steve's current PPPv2 version
  works on Linux x86 with Wine too: "wine ppp.exe ..."

2007-11-06:
- PPPv2 from John merged
- Windows binary now smaller, because it's Release build, not Debug

2007-10-30:
- merged John:s newest changes (thank's for mentioning it Lazier)
- fixed compiling on Linux, something got messed up when making
  previous version (thank's for mentioning it Andrew Burns)
- binaries for Linux and Windows in separate .zip

2007-10-28 later:
- Trying to get Makefiles right, using docs from
  http://vindaci.members.sonic.net/cbreak/projects/autotools/
-- added getloadavg.c from XEmacs, as hinted at
   https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/dapper-changes/2005-November/000547.html
   * Use AC_FUNC_GETLOADAVG and getloadavg.c from XEmacs, so that the
     system function is used first, then the getloadavg.c from at if it isn't
     available (closes: #269440)
  http://www.koders.com/c/fid3187DAB1E8DCB8E4FFDEB9F0C5D431FD436669D9.aspx?s=cdef%3Amd5
-- to get aclocal working, needed to patch /usr/share/aclocal/nspr.m4
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mozilla/+bug/5907
-- ok, now you can do:
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
   so that installs binary to /usr/local/bin/ppp
   To remove it just do:	sudo rm /usr/local/bin/ppp
   and to clean ppp dir just:	make clean
- FIX: added "#ifdef HAVE_SYS_TIME_H" so that it detects the need to use
       #include <time.h> or <sys/time.h>
- still needed "#ifdef __WIN32 <sys/time.h>"  too
- included Windows and Linux binaries
- to GenerateRandomKey combined #ifdefs:
  HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY, HAVE_GETHOSTNAME, HAVE_GETLOADAVG
  so less code duplication between WIN32 and Linux, and maybe may even
  work better on other linuxes

2007-10-28:
- updated John:s newest changes
- added ifdef __WIN32 for Windows-specific code
- function ConvertHexToKey fixed compile warning (hope I didn't break anything):
  return key->byte[j];   // Fix for "warning: control reaches end of non-void function"
- changed #include <sys/date.h> to <date.h> on Linux to get it compiling on Ubuntu Gutsy
  Gibbon, but maybe some Linux uses <sys/date.h> too?
- added CHANGELOG.txt, INSTALL.txt, AUTHORS.txt, LICENSE.txt

2007-10-27:
Changes to GenerateRandomSequenceKey function:
- added rdtsc by Kazutomo Yoshii (instead of loadavg)
  from: http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~kazutomo/rdtsc.html
- commented out gettimeofday and hostname, because I didn't yet find
  BSD or Public Domain code for them
- tried to get MAC Address with sample code from
  http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/I-N/network/networkinformation/article.php/c5451
  but didn't get it to compile without warnings, so not added.
