INSTALL

Windows
-------
1. Install MinGW Developer Studio for Windows from http://www.parinyasoft.com/

2. If you are on Vista, either:

   a) copy StartMinGW.bat to desktop and doubleclick it (easier way)

   b) add paths of the StartMinGW.bat to your environment variable, as quoted from
      http://techknowsis.beesquared.biz/2007/08/25/InstallingPHPOnWindowsVistaAndWindowsServer2003.aspx
      "In Vista, you can edit the PATH variable by going to the Control Panel --> System
      and Maintenance --> System window and clicking on the "Advanced system settings" link
      in the left column.  After you approve the UAC popup, the "System Properties" pane will open
      and you will see a button labeled "Environment Variables."
      Clicking this button will open the "Environment Variables" pane, and the PATH variable can be
      found in the "System variables" section."

3. After unzipping ppp_source.zip and starting MinGW Developer Studio:
    Project / Open Project  - ppp_source/ppp.msp
    Build / Compile - there'll come exe in ppp_source/Release/ppp.exe


Linux etc
---------
Linux etc

 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

so that installs binary to /usr/local/bin/ppp
To remove it just do: sudo rm /usr/local/bin/ppp
and to clean ppp dir just: make clean
